## James Monroe Thorington

<ins>James Monroe Thorington</ins> (1894-1989) was an opthamologist with a passion for mountaineering, serving as an active member in the American Alpine Club for over 60 years. Thorington spent 15 summers in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, between modern-day Jasper and Banff National Parks. He was the first person to climb the Canadian Rockies in their entirety. Though Thorington frequently wrote about his travels, this project focuses on his book *The Glittering Mountains of Canada* (1925), which covers three of such expeditions:
- [Summer of 1922:](https://mander4635.github.io/jmtgmc-wri241/browse.html#1st%20Expedition) Thorington embarks southwest from Amiskwi (Baker) Pass. The first half of his expedition is purely to map the Freshfield group of mountains. This group includes Mt. Barnard, which Thorington is the first to ever climb.
- [Summer of 1923:](https://mander4635.github.io/jmtgmc-wri241/browse.html#2nd%20Expedition) Thorington embarks northwest from Lake Louise towards Mt. Saskatchewan. He only successfully climbs four mountains in this expedition, though he is the first to climb three of the four.
- [Summer of 1924:](https://mander4635.github.io/jmtgmc-wri241/browse.html#3rd%20Expedition) Thorington begins his journey southwards, from the north end of Athabaska Pass, which he traversed the previous summer. He clears around 10 mountains, including Mt. Kane and Mt. Hooker, both of which he is the first to ever climb. This expedition is much less linear in its path, as he crosses the town of Jasper three times during the journey.

Rather than describing these ascents chronologically, Thorington breaks his journey into chapters based on geographic "groups" of mountains. This system of organization benefits travellers, who can pick and choose what mountains they climb in their vicinity based on Thorington's descriptions of climate and difficulty. This provides them much more direction than a set itinerary: readers and travellers alike are deterred from following in Thorington's precise footsteps.

Note that each "group" has at least one centrally located base camp, surrounded by at least four mountains: these "groups" appear to be invented by Thorington and only lightly take into account established provincial or geological boundaries. 

Although some of the names of the features of the Candian Rockies have changed over time, many of the original mountain names were decided by Thorington and his party, as they were the only team who had surveyed the Canadian Rockies in full by 1925. For consistency, this project uses the names Thorington provides of the mountains he depicts. However, updated versions of *The Glittering Mountains* have been subsequently produced by the American Alpine Club; they continue to be used as a guidebook to this date.
