## The Glittering Mountains

<ins>James Monroe Thorington</ins> (1894-1989) was an opthamologist with a passion for mountaineering, serving as an active member in the American Alpine Club for over 60 years. Thorington spent 15 seasons in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, between modern-day Jasper and Banff National Parks. He was the first person to climb the Canadian Rockies in their entirety. Though Thorington frequently wrote about his travels, this project focuses on his book *The Glittering Mountains of Canada* (1925), which covers three of such expeditions:
- [Summer of 1922:](https://mander4635.github.io/jmtgmc-wri241/browse.html#1st%20Expedition) Thorington embarks southwest from Amiskwi (Baker) Pass. The first half of his expedition is purely to map the Freshfield Icefield. This glacial plateau spreads between many mountains including Mt. Barnard, which Thorington is the first to ever climb.
- [Summer of 1923:](https://mander4635.github.io/jmtgmc-wri241/browse.html#2nd%20Expedition) Thorington embarks northwest from Lake Louise towards Mt. Saskatchewan. He only successfully climbs four mountains in this expedition, though he is the first to ever climb three of these four.
- [Summer of 1924:](https://mander4635.github.io/jmtgmc-wri241/browse.html#3rd%20Expedition) Thorington begins his journey southwards, from the north end of Athabaska Pass, which he traversed the previous summer. He clears around 10 mountains, including Mt. Kane and Mt. Hooker, both of which he is the first to ever climb. This expedition is longer and less linear in its path than previously mentioned expeditions, as he crosses the town of Jasper three times during the journey.

Rather than describing these ascents chronologically, the book breaks Thorington's journey into chapters based on geographic "groups" of mountains. This system of organization benefits travellers, who can pick and choose what mountains they climb in their vicinity based on Thorington's descriptions of climate and difficulty. This provides them much more direction than a set itinerary: readers and travellers alike are deterred from following in Thorington's precise footsteps.

Note that each "group" has at least one centrally located base camp, surrounded by at least four mountains: these "groups" appear to be invented by Thorington and only lightly take into account established provincial or geological boundaries. 

Although some of the names of the features of the Candian Rockies have changed over time, many of the original mountain names were decided by Thorington and his party, as they were the only team who had surveyed the Canadian Rockies in full by 1925. For consistency, this project uses the names Thorington provides of the mountains he mentions. However, updated versions of *The Glittering Mountains* have been subsequently produced by the American Alpine Club; they continue to be used as a guidebook to this date.

## Thorington's Rockies

Despite the increasing efficiency of planes and cars in the 1920s, the Canadian Rocky Mountains were still vastly inaccessible to the public. They were largely considered to be "frontier": untampered land, nature in its purest form. As one of the earliest mountaineers to climb the Canadian Rockies, J.M. Thorington is one of the sole sources of "insider" information on this mountain range in the interwar period. He further sets himself apart by citing, consolidating, and commenting on the narratives of Canadian mountaineers before him in his writings. This dichotomy of access between the public and the mountaineer places Thorington in a position of great power, as he relays his perception of the mountains to the public in *The Glittering Mountains*.

In a sense, Thorington thus has control over the geography of the Canadian Rockies in the public eye. This geography is not based on objectivity– Thorington is far from a geoscientist– but rather based on narrative, the concept of adventure and the strength of the general public's imagination.

> *"No map of a river valley can visualize a Canadian forest, with laden horses swinging along in line; no plaster relief can ever make one understand the moods of mountains, half-hidden in cloud or towering in the many-hued glory of early morning… These trails are not for everyone, but for those who go there will result such memories 'as dreams are made on', and the reward is great enough."* Thorington, The Glittering Mountains (256)

One may question, then, if Thorington is truly attempting to convey the *mountains* to his audience. As much as his writing depicts the Canadian Rockies themselves, what he seems to moreso capture is the sublime: the fear-like feeling that nature is greater than us, we being merely a small part of it. We see Thorington time and time again as a little shadowed speck in an otherwise snowy landscape; there is no telling whether he has conquered the Canadian Rockies, or if the Rockies have conquered him.

> *“The irresistible power of nature allows us, considered as sensuous beings, to recognize our powerlessness indeed, but at the same time reveals in us a capability, to judge ourselves as independent of nature, and a superiority over nature, upon which a self-preservation of a completely different kind is grounded, than is that which can be challenged by the nature outside us."* Kant, Critique of Aesthetic Judgement

Thorington not only constructs the bird's-eye geography of the Canadian Rockies, he also constructs the place of humans within his geography. Inviting his audience to take up mountaineering, Thorington seems to promote the Canadian Rockies as (in the words of De Certeau) both a *map*- a geography understood from outside a space- and a *tour*- a geography understood from inside a space. Thorington ultimately breaks down the remoteness of the Canadian Rockies from all angles, letting the public into his vision of the mountain range as a destination for those willing to challenge themselves against the greatest of natural features.
